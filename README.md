# SQL from Scratch â€” Hands-On Journey for Data Scientists & Engineers

Welcome to **SQL from Scratch**, a complete, practice-based SQL learning journey designed to take you from **beginner** to **intermediate** level â€” fully preparing you for SQL-related work as a **Data Scientist** or **Data Engineer**.

This project includes structured modules, real-world datasets, and hands-on exercises using the `sales_company` database.

## 1. Project Overview

This repository is part of a complete learning program:
> **Goal:** Build strong, practical SQL skills through guided lessons, interactive challenges, and real-world analytics projects.

Youâ€™ll start from the fundamentals and progress toward complex analytical queries, data modeling, and optimization â€” exactly whatâ€™s needed in professional environments.

## 3. Practice Database

The entire program uses a real-world simulation dataset called **`sales_company`**, which models a retail sales environment.

### **Database Schema**
- `customers` â€” customer details  
- `orders` â€” customer orders  
- `order_items` â€” line items for each order  
- `products` â€” catalog of available products  


### **Relationships**

The logical flow of the database follows the typical structure of a sales system â€” from customers placing orders, to specific items being ordered, and products being referenced.

```mermaid
erDiagram
    CUSTOMERS ||--o{ ORDERS : "places"
    ORDERS ||--|{ ORDER_ITEMS : "contains"
    PRODUCTS ||--o{ ORDER_ITEMS : "referenced in"
    
    CUSTOMERS {
        int customer_id PK
        varchar first_name
        varchar last_name
        varchar email
        varchar country
        date signup_date
    }
    
    ORDERS {
        int order_id PK
        int customer_id FK
        date order_date
    }
    
    ORDER_ITEMS {
        int order_item_id PK
        int order_id FK
        int product_id FK
        int quantity
    }
    
    PRODUCTS {
        int product_id PK
        varchar product_name
        varchar category
        decimal price
        boolean in_stock
    }
```

### Logical flow

This diagram visually represents how customer purchases relate to orders, order details, and the product catalog.

```

```

An ERD (Entity-Relationship Diagram) is included in the **Appendix** section of the project folder.

## 4. Learning Outcomes

By completing this hands-on journey, youâ€™ll be able to:

- Write and optimize SQL queries confidently  
- Design and query relational databases  
- Perform data aggregation, analytics, and reporting  
- Apply SQL to real-world data engineering and data science scenarios  
- Understand and visualize database relationships  

---

## 5. Requirements

To follow along locally, install one of the following:

- **MySQL 8.0+**
- **PostgreSQL 14+**
- **SQLite 3+**

Then import the dataset:

```
mysql -u root -p < sales_company.sql
```
